# VBA_Challange_ZR
For Module 2 challenge I created a VBA script that run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once to produce following information as requested in the challenge. 

•	The ticker symbol
•	Quarterly change  =  (Close price- Open price) for each ticker.
•	The percentage change = (Quarterly change / Open price) *100.
•	The total stock volume of each  stock.


Additionally, 
stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume" were found for each quarter. 

I used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red as per the reference  here. https://www.excelmojo.com/vba-conditional-formatting/

To do a test run I Used  the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing the code.
